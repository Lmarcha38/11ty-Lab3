<!-- ChatGPT "i need two blog posts written from the perspective of a lone human interstellar explorer, one about a new strange planet, and the other about passing by a black hole" -->

{% blogpost 'Blog Post 2: <strong>Passing the Void</strong>' 'Exploration Log: Black Hole Encounter' 'Day 352, Year 134 of my journey.' 'I didn’t think I’d ever get this close. The ship’s sensors have been warning me for hours now—approaching the event horizon of a black hole. No turning back now. There’s something awe-inspiring about the sight of it. From a distance, it looks like a perfect, inky black circle against the backdrop of space. But as I draw nearer, its presence becomes more… overwhelming. The curvature of spacetime around it distorts everything. Stars near the black hole warp into strange shapes, stretching and bending, their light pulled into the singularity. I know the risks—nobody gets close to a black hole and lives to tell the tale. But I’m not actually crossing the event horizon; just passing near it. The ship’s artificial gravity is holding steady, and my engines are working overtime to maintain a safe trajectory. It feels like I’m drifting in the edge of nothingness, as if the universe itself is holding its breath. Time seems to slow, or maybe it’s just my perception of it. The fabric of reality feels thinner here. I can see things that I never thought possible—ripples in the fabric of space, bending in ways that shouldn’t be. I’ve tried to record it, but I know the data will likely be incomprehensible to anyone else. I’ve been reading old astronaut logs, stories of others who’ve passed close to these cosmic giants. They describe feelings of insignificance, a humbling realization that in the grand scheme of the universe, we are nothing but fleeting flashes of light. I don’t know if that’s what I feel. Maybe it’s too early to tell. But for now, I’m just trying to stay focused. Getting too close could mean losing everything. I’ll keep my eyes on the path ahead. No more distractions.' %}
