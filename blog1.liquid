{% blogpost 'Blog Post 1: <strong>A Stranger’s World</strong>' 'Exploration Log: Planet XG-395' 'Day 247, Year 134 of my journey.' 'I’ve been here for a little over a week now. XG-395, a planet orbiting a relatively quiet star at the edge of an uncharted system. It’s... bizarre. I’ve seen many planets in my travels, but this one has a vibe that feels alien on a level I didn’t expect. The atmosphere is dense, made up of compounds that don’t quite resemble anything we’ve encountered in the known systems. It’s breathable, but my skin feels like it’s absorbing the air itself, heavy with something I can’t describe. The gravity’s a little stronger than Earth’s, which makes moving around a challenge at first. Everything here is oddly symmetrical, almost too perfect—mountain ranges that stretch in straight lines for miles, vast oceans that appear to be mirror-still, reflecting the same sky forever. There are large, crystalline formations scattered across the surface, like jagged monuments thrusting out from the earth, but they don’t seem to follow any natural pattern. I found something curious today. A structure, small but distinctly artificial. It doesn’t look like anything from human or known alien civilizations, though its materials are surprisingly familiar—metallic alloys and stone, worn by time but still standing. The interior is empty, eerily so. Whatever it was built for, it’s been abandoned for a long time. I’ve been recording data for the scientists back home, but a part of me feels uneasy. There’s something about this place that doesn’t feel right. Like it’s holding a secret, just waiting to reveal it. I’m staying another few days, hoping to learn more. But I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched.' %}
